          My name is Alvino, I'm a on-progress full-stack developer who
          likes to learn things, I'm currently learning various programming
          language such as Python, Javascript, and website building. Im
          currently enrolling in Vocational High-School as Computer and Network
          Engineering, but I am trying to surf in Arduino such as making RC Car,
          and many robotic stuff.
